# PromptGenius System Architecture Patterns

## Core Architecture

The PromptGenius plugin is built on a modular, event-driven architecture that leverages the AnythingLLM platform's capabilities. The key components are:

1. **Manifest Configuration**: The `manifest.json` file defines the plugin's metadata, capabilities, and configuration options.

2. **Prompt Management**: The `handler.js` module is responsible for processing, indexing, and serving prompts. It utilizes an LRU cache for performance optimization.

3. **Prompt Indexing**: Prompts are categorized and indexed by various attributes (category, tags, name) for efficient search and retrieval.

4. **Context-Aware Prompts**: The system can dynamically inject relevant context into prompts based on user information and usage patterns.

5. **Plugin Interface**: The plugin exposes a set of actions (generate, search, contextual) that can be invoked by the AnythingLLM platform.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**: Comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms are in place to ensure reliability and observability.

## Design Patterns

1. **Facade Pattern**: The `PromptGenius` class acts as a facade, providing a simplified interface to the underlying prompt management logic.

2. **Singleton Pattern**: The `PromptGenius` class is implemented as a singleton to ensure a single instance is used throughout the application.

3. **Observer Pattern**: The plugin leverages event-driven architecture, allowing the AnythingLLM platform to subscribe to relevant plugin events.

4. **Indexing Pattern**: The prompt data is indexed by various attributes to enable efficient search and retrieval.

5. **Caching Pattern**: An LRU cache is used to improve the performance of prompt generation and retrieval.

6. **Separation of Concerns**: The plugin's functionality is divided into distinct modules (manifest, handler, indexing) to promote maintainability and testability.

## Future Architectural Considerations

1. **Prompt Personalization**: Implement user preference learning to provide personalized prompt recommendations.
2. **Distributed Caching**: Explore distributed caching solutions to scale prompt management across multiple instances.
3. **Microservices Architecture**: Consider a microservices-based approach to decouple prompt management, search, and context injection.
4. **Serverless Functions**: Investigate the use of serverless functions to handle prompt generation and processing.
